# GEM
**Game Boy Emulator Multiplatform**

GEM is a Game Boy emulator written in C# using [MonoGame](https://www.monogame.org/) framework.

This is a personal hobby and learning project inspired by [The Ultimate Game Boy Talk](https://media.ccc.de/v/33c3-8029-the_ultimate_game_boy_talk) by Michael Steil.
